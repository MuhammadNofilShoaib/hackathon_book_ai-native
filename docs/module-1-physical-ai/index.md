## Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI that operates on abstract data to AI that operates in the physical world. This module will cover the core principles that make AI systems capable of interacting with the physical environment.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI
- Explain the concept of embodied intelligence
- Understand how physical interaction shapes AI behavior
- Apply basic simulation techniques to model physical AI systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of AI and robotics concepts
- Familiarity with programming concepts
- Access to a computer capable of running simulation software
