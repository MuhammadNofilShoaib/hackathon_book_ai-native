# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

Welcome to the capstone project of the AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This project integrates all the concepts covered in the previous modules to design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot system.

## Project Overview

The capstone project challenges you to design, simulate, and implement a complete humanoid robot system that demonstrates:

- Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Digital twin simulation using Gazebo and/or Unity
- NVIDIA Isaac AI platform integration
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Design and Planning (Weeks 1-2)
- Define the humanoid robot specifications
- Design the robot's physical structure
- Plan the AI systems integration
- Create a project timeline and milestones

### Phase 2: Simulation Development (Weeks 3-6)
- Create a digital twin of the humanoid robot
- Implement basic locomotion and manipulation
- Develop perception systems
- Test in simulation environments

### Phase 3: AI Integration (Weeks 7-10)
- Integrate NVIDIA Isaac for AI capabilities
- Implement VLA systems for human interaction
- Develop learning and adaptation mechanisms
- Test AI functionality in simulation

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Weeks 11-14)
- Integrate all subsystems
- Conduct comprehensive testing
- Optimize performance
- Prepare demonstration

## Learning Objectives
