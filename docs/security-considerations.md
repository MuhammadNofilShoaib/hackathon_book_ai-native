# Security Considerations for Physical AI Systems

This document outlines security considerations for the AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

## Physical Security

### Robot Safety
- Ensure robots operate within safe parameters
- Implement emergency stop mechanisms
- Validate all movements before execution
- Monitor for unexpected behaviors

### Access Control
- Limit physical access to robot systems
- Implement authentication for robot control
- Secure communication channels
- Log all access attempts

## Cybersecurity

### Communication Security
- Encrypt all communication between components
- Use secure protocols (HTTPS, WSS, etc.)
- Validate all inputs from external sources
- Implement secure API endpoints

### Data Protection
- Protect sensitive data collected by robots
- Implement data encryption at rest
- Secure data transmission
- Ensure compliance with privacy regulations

## Simulation Security

### Environment Security
- Secure simulation environments
- Protect against malicious inputs
- Validate all simulation parameters
- Monitor for anomalous behaviors

## Implementation Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow security best practices for the platform

### Regular Security Updates
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Apply security patches promptly
- Regularly review and update security measures
- Conduct security audits

## Testing Security Measures

### Security Testing
- Perform penetration testing
- Test for common vulnerabilities
- Validate security controls
- Document security test results
