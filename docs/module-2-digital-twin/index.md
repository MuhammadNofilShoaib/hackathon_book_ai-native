# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This module focuses on digital twins and simulation environments, specifically Gazebo and Unity, which are crucial for developing and testing robotic systems before deploying them in the physical world.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that can be used for simulation, analysis, and optimization. In robotics, digital twins allow us to test algorithms, validate designs, and train AI models in a safe, cost-effective virtual environment before deploying to real robots.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Define digital twins and explain their importance in robotics
- Set up and run simulations in Gazebo
- Set up and run simulations in Unity
- Compare the strengths and weaknesses of different simulation environments
- Use simulations to validate robotic algorithms

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Access to a computer capable of running simulation software
- Familiarity with ROS 2 concepts (will be covered in Module 3)
