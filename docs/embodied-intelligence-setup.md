# Embodied Intelligence Setup

This document outlines the setup process for embodied intelligence examples in the textbook.

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied intelligence refers to the integration of AI with physical systems, allowing AI to interact with the real world through sensors and actuators.

## Setup Requirements

1. Robot platform (physical or simulated)
2. Sensor systems (cameras, LIDAR, IMU, etc.)
3. Actuator systems (motors, servos, etc.)
4. Computing platform capable of running AI models
5. Communication interfaces (ROS 2, etc.)

## Example Platforms

- TurtleBot 3 (simulated or physical)
- Fetch Robotics platform
- NVIDIA JetBot for edge AI
- Custom robot platforms
