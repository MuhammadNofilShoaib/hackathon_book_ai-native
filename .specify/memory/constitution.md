# Hackathon Book 1 Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy & Technical Correctness
All robotics, AI, and simulation concepts must be correct and verified using official documentation (ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, Unity).

### Clarity & Pedagogical Quality
Content should be suitable for students and professionals with basic AI/robotics knowledge, explained in clear, structured, modular form.

### Practical Reproducibility
Step-by-step guides for code, simulations, and hardware setup must allow students to reproduce experiments and results.

### Embodied Intelligence Focus
Emphasize bridging digital AI knowledge to physical robotic systems.

### Interactivity Preparation
Structure content to later support AI-native features like chatbots and personalization.

### Content Sourcing & Standards
Reference official documentation, research papers, and textbooks for ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, Unity; APA style citations; Modular content divided into course modules.

## Key Standards
Content Sourcing: Reference official documentation, research papers, and textbooks for ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, Unity, and AI models; Citation Format: APA style for all sources; Content Modularization: Divide book into modules/weeks as per course structure: Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™), Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA), Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid; Code & Simulation Examples: Provide working Python/ROS 2 code snippets, URDF models, simulation instructions, and VLA integration examples; Writing Style: Clear, concise, academic yet approachable, suitable for students with intermediate AI/robotics knowledge.

## Constraints
Format: Docusaurus book deployed to GitHub Pages; Word Count per Module: 3,000–5,000 words including examples; Hardware/Software Instructions: Include minimum required hardware setup, cloud alternatives, and Edge Kit usage; Simulation Coverage: Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim examples must be included; No Chatbot Implementation Yet: Focus on book content only; RAG chatbot integration will follow later.

## Governance
All technical content is verified against official sources; Book is complete, well-structured, and interactive-ready; Includes working code and simulation examples; Deployment to GitHub Pages is live and readable; Passes peer-review / mentor feedback for clarity, correctness, and pedagogy.
